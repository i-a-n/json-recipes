  "instructions": [
    "Use a food processor to blend the tofu into a paste. When all the tofu is blended, transfer into a large bowl and finely chop about half the herbs. Transfer the herbs, some salt & pepper, and all of the chicken powder (all of this is to taste) into the tofu mixture and combine evenly.",
    "Wrap in cheesecloth and leave in a collander to drain, with a weight on top, overnight.",
    "The next day, Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Plop the tofu onto a turkey-basting pan and shape the tofu mixture into a turkey-shape. Use a spatula and dip it in water to really help sculpt that thing.",
    "Combine balsamic, red wine, dijon, and the rest of your herbs and spices into a marinade. Brush/pour maybe half of it over the tofurkey, then place it in the oven.",
    "Add the remaining marindate, basting occassionally, for the next two hours, or longer. If the tofurkey browns too quickly, cover with aluminum foil to ensure it's thoroughly heated through."
