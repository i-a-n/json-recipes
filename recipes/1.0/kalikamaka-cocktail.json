    "To make the cinnamon syrup, combine 1 cup water with 1 cup sugar, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer for 8-10 minutes until sugar has dissolved, stirring frequently. Let cool. Ditch the cinnamon sticks, strain into a clean glass jar and cover. Store refrigerated for up to two weeks.",
    "To make the cocktail, throw everything in a shaker with ice and shake it up good. Rim a martini glass lightly with cinnamon, and fill the glass with the chilled booze. Garnish with a cinnamon stick and enjoy the holidays!"
