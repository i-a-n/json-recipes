  "instructions": [
    "Warm the oil in a Dutch oven over high heat. Add half the mushrooms, season with salt, and brown for 5 minutes, stirring once or twice. Meanwhile, spread the potatoes on a plate or a shallow bowl and microwave for 3 to 5 minutes; they should be about halfway cooked, not fully. (If you don’t have a microwave, you can parcook in salted boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes instead.) Transfer the first batch of mushrooms to a plate, add a little more oil if the pan is dry, and brown the second batch the same way, seasoning with salt and transferring them to the plate when done.",
    "Reduce the heat to medium-high. Add the butter to the pot, then the onion. Season with salt and cook for 3 minutes, stirring, until the onion just begins to soften. Add the garlic and cook for 2 more minutes, until the onion is soft and the garlic is fragrant. Reduce the heat to low and add the sweet and smoked paprikas; stir well to combine the spices with the onion. Add the wine, increase the heat to medium and let it come to a simmer while you scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. Add the vegetable stock and the crushed tomatoes, then the potatoes and mushrooms, along with any liquid that accumulated on the plate. Season generously with black pepper. Increase the heat to high to bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cover the pot. Cook for 15 minutes.",
    "Uncover the pot and cook for about 5 minutes more, until the potatoes are fully tender and the liquid has reduced a bit. Meanwhile, combine the sour cream and flour in a medium bowl, then whisk a few ladlefuls of the hot liquid into the sour cream mixture. Reduce the heat to low, then add the sour cream mixture and herbs to the pot. Stir well, and adjust the texture of the stew with up to ½ cup of water if it is too thick for your taste. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if you like."
